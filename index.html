          <p>
          Born and raised in Northeast Ohio, from a young age I held a fascination
         with computers and technology. I taught myself to be proficient in a
          wide variety of consumer tech products and founded a tech service
           business while in high school. I am college educated and hold degrees
            in accounting and economics from Ohio University. After venturing
            into the accounting world, I realized that I was neither doing what
            I loved or tangibly helping people. I then pursued tech service
            full-time as the sole proprietor of <span><a href="http://www.ryanspinktech.com">R.S. Tech</a></span>
            in Chautauqua, NY and most recently Denver, CO. I am now pursuing my passion for software
            development in the Back-End Engineering program at the
            Turing School of Software and Design in Denver, CO. In the future I
            hope to join my passion for making a difference in people's lives
            with pursuits in software development.
