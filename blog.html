            I recently learned about the basics of artifical neural networks while researching for a lightning talk at Turing. It is fascinating to see how these complex software connections are created, used, and are literally everywhere in our modern high-tech world. An artificial neural network is a simulation of how neruons in the brain, en masse, interact with each other to make decisions. They consist of units that are separated into input, hidden, and output functions. Input units receive info and pass them along to hidden units via connections called weights. Weights modify the information being passed and the accumulation of data at the next unit will either fire or not depending on the value of the information that they've received. This progresses until the information reaches the output units, where the modified information is presented to the user. Neural networks "learn" by backpropogation, or through feedback being sent backwards through the output units to modify the weights between the hidden units. This effectively teaches the artificial network to produces a desired outcome. The network is then used on a completely new dataset to see how effective it is at identifying correlations within it and the feedback process begins again. Neural networks are in everything from cellphones to airplane autopilots. They help build software for abstract situations like self-driving cars and giving a robot responsibilities to make descisions based on a continually changing surrounding environment. I will continue to research this topic, and hope to progress my knowledge to a point of better understanding more of it's complexities.

            Mod-1 is complete...<a href="https://youtu.be/RBbVAoDzVHU?t=13shooray!">hooray!</a>
            Throughout mod-1 I continually pushed myself to learn new concepts
            and become proficient at them through research, application, and
            repitition. I learned more in six weeks than I though possible and am very satsfied
            with the quality of education I'm receiving at Turing. One subject
            that particularly piqued my interest was data analysis.

            Our final project, Headcount, tackled this concept head on. We were
            given CSV files from which we had to store data in respective repositories.
            From these repositories we analyzed variance, correlation, and other
            statistical occurances between sets of data. Having majored in Economics
            in college, data analysis (regression in particular) fascinates me.
            I hope to further progress my skills in this area in software development
            and am keeping data science in mind for future scholastic
            pursuits.
