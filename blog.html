            Mod-1 is complete...<a href="https://youtu.be/RBbVAoDzVHU?t=13shooray!">hooray!</a>
            Throughout mod-1 I continually pushed myself to learn new concepts
            and become proficient at them through research, application, and
            repitition. I learned more in six weeks than I though possible and am very satsfied
            with the quality of education I'm receiving at Turing. One subject
            that particularly piqued my interest was data analysis.

          <p>
            Our final project, Headcount, tackled this concept head on. We were
            given CSV files from which we had to store data in respective repositories.
            From these repositories we analyzed variance, correlation, and other
            statistical occurances between sets of data. Having majored in Economics
            in college, data analysis (regression in particular) fascinates me.
            I hope to further progress my skills in this area in software development
            and am keeping data science in mind for future scholastic
            pursuits.
